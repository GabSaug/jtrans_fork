# News
* \[2022/6/9\] We release the preprocessing code and [BinaryCorp](https://cloud.vul337.team:8443/s/cxnH8DfZTADLKCs), the dataset we used in our paper.
* \[2022/5/26\] jTrans is now on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12713.pdf).

# Dataset
- We present a new large-scale and diversified dataset, [BinaryCorp](https://cloud.vul337.team:8443/s/cxnH8DfZTADLKCs), for the task of binary code similarity detection. 
- The description of the dataset can be found at [here](datautils/README.md) and we give an [example](datautils/playdata.py) for using BinaryCorp.
