Usage:
launch the conda env: conda activate jtrans (following the git's Readme)

Create the dataset, idb, log folders

Fill the dataset/ folder with the binaries to extract function embeddings from run .clean.sh script

run LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/gab/anaconda3/envs/jtrans/lib/  python3 run.py

Be careful avout the naming of the binaries in the dataset folder:
bin-Ox-padding -> For us, Ox should be Op (perturbed) for p" and Ob (base) for p
